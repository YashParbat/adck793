      <h3>Yash Parbat</h3>
      <p> Hi. I am from Mombasa,Kenya which is in East Africa. Having no prioir coding experience I am quite excited to have 
          attended the bootcamp and learnt a lot over the past few days. Bootcamp, in my opinion, was a great way to familirise with 
          what to expect in the coming future as far as the course is concerned.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Drawing Stars</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates what I have learnt during the bootcamp
        and for this project mostly the use of loops,methods and randomness. I created a star which 
        is drawn by altering the position of lines and changed the colour of the lines to make it 
        more decorative.
