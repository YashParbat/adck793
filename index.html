      <h3>Yash Parbat</h3>
      <p> Hi. I am from Mombasa,Kenya which is in East Africa. Having no prioir coding experience I am quite excited to have 
          attended the bootcamp and learnt a lot over the past few days. Bootcamp, in my opinion, was a great way to familirise with 
          what to expect in the coming future as far as the course is concerned.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Drawing Stars</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates what I have learnt during the bootcamp
        and for this project mostly the use of loops,methods and randomness. I created a star which 
        is drawn by altering the position of lines and changed the colour of the lines to make it 
        more decorative.

    <h3>Spring Project</h3>
    <p>
	For my spring project I made a game called "Egyptian Block Breaker".This game adopts all the concepts we learnt in the lectures and some concepts I learnt over the internet. It was really fun trying out new things, while trying to explore the possibilites of the city engine library. During the development of this project one of the most difficult challenges I faced was spending hours trying to fix bugs in my code so that the game could work flawlessly. All in all it was a good experience to learn a new programming language.
